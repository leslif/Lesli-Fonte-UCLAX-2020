A test environment is a server which allows you to test your website. It provides a dedicated environment 
for you to isolate the code and verify the behavior of the site. It can act as the exact copy of the 
production environment. 

Local testing allows you to be able to test a work in progress site at scale without hosting them on public 
staging environments. It is how we are testing our sites in class. We launch a local server on our browser 
and are able to test our changes. Anyone with the folder information for our site can run this on their 
local server. It is useful for single developers when they are working on building their portion of a site's 
code and see results in real time.

Dev testing is done at the construction stage of a site. It aims to eliminate errors before code goes to QA. 
It increases efficiency through the testing process because errors are spotted quickly as code is being 
written making the QA process more streamlined. 

QA testing can combine manual and automated testing methods. Manual testing is done by highly skilled 
testers who represent the different user profiles of the site and use a wide range of operating systems. 
It's letting the site out into the world and testing it by other people who haven't yet seen the site, 
outside of developers. But these people are connected to the business and can understand the goals, 
objectives and the code themselves so they can give valuable feedback. They work in a controlled testing 
environment, not production space.

Production testing is testing the site's functionalities once the site has gone live. It requires daily 
testing of key application functions and ensuring everything is working correctly. QA testers will have a 
daily checklist of what to evaluate to make sure the site is running smoothly.
