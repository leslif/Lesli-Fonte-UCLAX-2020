Relative paths - don't need to have full web address as the URL. When a user clicks a relative link, the browser 
takes them to that location on the current site. The link's path is relative to the current document being displayed
by the browser. You can only use relative links when linking to pages or files within your site.
This allows you to link to folders or subfolders within your site easily. It is easier for 
developers to use relative links because the root site is always the same and they just have to link to different 
pages within the root site. It simplifies code and makes it more streamlined.
Folder and file names are always case sensitive. 
You use ../ to go up one directory and a / to go into folders. Each / represents moving down one level in the folder
hierarchy.
Relative links should always open in the same browser page.
If the domain name is changed, using relative links will make that transition much easier.

Document relative paths are the paths to use for local links in most websites. 

Absolute paths - are used when linking to another website. You must use the full URL when linking to these sites
(http://wwww. etc). One benefit to using absolute paths for internal links is that it can improve SEO.
You can set absolute links to other websites to open in a new window by using target="_blank" attribute so the
user doesn't actually leave your page when they click the link.
