JPG
A JPEG is an image file format that supports lossy compression. It can support millions of colors and 
provides better image quality. It can also be compressed to small sizes although some details can be 
lost upon compression. It is a raster image which means if the image resolution is low, it can not be 
sized at a large scale. It is limited to how the photo was originally taken or imported. Also each 
compression damages the resolution slightly so if it is compressed too many times, it can degrade 
considerably.

GIF
A GIF is an image file format that can not only support static images but also animated images. GIFs are 
made from a series of static images that together in sequence form an animation. They can also support 
transparency, but not full Alpha transparency. So it cannot capture all the subtleties of a true gradation 
to transparency.  It cannot display as many colors as a jpeg. Rather, it's limited at 256 colors.

PNG
A PNG is an image file format that can support true alpha transparency. It is good for logos and other 
images that require full transparency. PNG also supports lossless compression so it is better suited for 
this purpose over jpeg. However, PNGs often result in larger file sizes. 

SVG
SVGs are vector graphics. They are infinitely scalable, which makes them suited for logos and images that 
need to be scaled very large, for example, for a billboard. However, vector graphics cannot typically be 
photos. They appear more flat and use a series of shapes and flat colors to create their image. They also 
have very small file sizes even at very large sizes. The flat colors and shapes allow for less information 
stored in each pixel.
