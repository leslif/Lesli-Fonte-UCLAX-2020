Web accessibility means making websites accessible or usable for people with limited 
means. This can include physical and/or mental disabilities; people of a certain age; 
people who don't have access to certain hardware, like a computer mouse; people who 
are using different devices, like mobile phones; and others. 
It is important because as developers/ designers, we have to keep in mind the user 
base and make it usable by everyone, not just the ideal case. It is the law in some 
states, so a company could get sued if their site is not accessible. 
The W3C has put together guidelines of how to make websites more accessible. Some 
examples are:
- making sure to use alt text to describe a visual image on a page (with some 
exceptions, like decoration)
- having an audio as well as a sign language/ captions supplement to video features
- having your text be able to be read by a screen reader software
- using keyboard functions for form fields and to navigate other elements on a page
- UI design - colors that contrast significantly enough that a color blind or visually impaired person can see the content more easily; but color cannot be the sole thing used to distinguish an element on the page
- do not design a page in a way that is known to cause seizures; no bright and rapid 
flashes, and animation can be stopped as needed 
- different reading levels are available
- default language is programmatically determined
- errors are to be described to the user in text
- labels or instruction is given to input fields

These are just some of the concepts. Accessibility can be expensive to implement once 
a site has been developed and is in use. It is best to program these features into 
the site at the development stage, as they are relatively simple to employ.
