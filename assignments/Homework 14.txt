What is a CSS preprocessor? Examples. In react, what are styled components? How do styled components violate the
separation of concerns?

CSS preprocessor:
A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you write CSS using that specific processor's unique syntax. It is a way for you to 
write CSS outside of CSS. It then translates the code you've written into accurate CSS for browsers to be able to read. It is 
helpful because it is an efficient way of writing the CSS styles in one program. There are also some features within these 
preprocessors that don't exist in pure CSS so they have some additional advantages. 
Some examples are: Sass, Less, and Stylus

Styled-components is a way of bringing in CSS styles into Javascript and writing them together without having to keep the files 
separate. This violates separation of concerns because traditionally, these things should all be kept separate and this is the 
exact opposite of that.
