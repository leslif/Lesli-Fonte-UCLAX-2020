What it means for a company to be Agile...
Agile means that cross functional teams are involved in the development process. Business leaders, 
designers, engineers, developers work together to establish goals and then create solutions. So instead 
of a waterfall approach where goals are set by business leadership (sometimes goals that are not
feasible) and then passing down those instructions to designers who then design in their own silo 
and then send designs off to developers who develop in their own silos, these various teams will work
together at each stage of the process to define goals, limitations, and solutions together. 
The pros are that solutions can be created more quickly and more efficiently because you're not 
constantly going up and down this waterfall with revisions. Revisions and instructions can be 
rec'd by all parties at the same time so everyone can retain the same vision. When issues arise, they
can be quickly handled when everyone is involved. It also means you can break down a larger problem
into smaller parts and work on them with the entire team, which can result in higher speeds for
product updates and creation of new features. As opposed to a model where tasks are more high level and 
can take a year or more to fully execute. 
Some cons are that every team needs to be able to communicate with the other in languages that they can 
understand and also that with an agile process, there are clear deadlines that have to be met at the 
potential cost of some possibly better innovations or additional research.
