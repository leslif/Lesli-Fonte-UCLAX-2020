Web hosts, domains, FTP...

Web hosting - 
A service that allows organizations and individuals to post a website onto the Internet. They will provide a server for your 
website to be viewed and contain all the pages of your site. You are required to have your own domain that the host will access. 
Web hosts are required to have a website. They also keep your site up and running and you also have access to them for support 
and troubleshooting. 

Domain - 
Your website's URL. It is a name that you own and no one else can use. You can also use your domain name and the web hosting 
service's email address features to create a custom email name. A web host is a computer and has an IP address associated with it. 
So whenever someone enters a URL into their browser they are connecting to a computer with a unique IP number. Domain names were 
created to make it easy for human users to remember and type in the address of where they want to go without having to type in this 
unique IP address. 

FTP - 
File Transfer Protocol - a way to transfer files online
FTP access lets you upload files from your computer to the web server. So if you build your own website through HTML files you can 
transfer the files from your computer to the web server through FTP.
HTTP is an example of a protocol; there are others - IMAP POP XMPP
It is not very common anymore due to cloud based services 
IT professionals may choose to use FTP when moving large amounts of server files within an organization.
FTP is not secure, they aren't encrypted and it's easy to intercept files. FTPS is used for more security.
