ID
IDs are unique, they can only be used one time on; each page can only have one element with that ID. 
Information that is unique should be kept in an ID. Can be used to link to one particular piece on a 
website full of similar pieces, for example, linking to one comment on a link with many comments. Us an 
ID when you have a single element on the page that will take that style.

Class
Classes are not unique. You can apply the same class to multiple elements. Information that is reusable 
should be kept in a class. For the comment example above, all comments would be in the same class of 
"comment" but each comment itself can have a unique ID. A class is a type of item whereas an ID is a unique 
name of an item on a page. Use class when you have multiple elements on the page that will take that style. 

Tag
Tags are identifiers in HTML that surround content and give meaning to it. They are represented by <> 
brackets. Anything that is content in HTML should have an opening tag and a closing tag and the content 
sits between them.
