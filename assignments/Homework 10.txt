HTML images:
- Use <img> tag
- Can be clickable
- Can be tagged for SEO readability
- Are important for actual content of the site
- Can contain "alt" text for accessibility and searchability
- To have images print by default when user prints page
- HTML images are good if you have an image that is not the right size - you can alter height and width with CSS separately

CSS images:
- Are solely for appearance
- Do not contain content
- Ex. Background images, things that are not clickable, used only for appearance
- can be used for repeating images or icons that are not related to content
- to replace text (like headers) with images
- can add overlays, like shadows, to images 
- if you want the image to change when the cursor hovers over it
