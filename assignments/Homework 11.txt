The right size for an image takes into consideration:
- the type of file being used (jpg, png, gif etc)
- how fast can the image/ video load on the page
- at what size will it be viewed (mobile/ desktop)
- has to be scalable to an extent so it can be sized up or down depending on platform being used
- depends on size of container
- images that need to stretch to fill a container should be at least 1500px or they can get blurry 
- Images for web generally should be less than 500kb
- DPI and PPI affect image's print quality but not display for web, so dimensions should be focused on and 
sized accordingly to keep file size small 
- SVGs can be uploaded at a large size and then resized in CSS accordingly since their file size is already 
so small
- GIFs should be saved in the size you want to view them on the site. They are large and can slow down the 
site if uploaded at actual size

Videos can be multiple different qualities from standard to high-def but should give the user the option of 
choosing which quality they want to view. Videos are hosted on websites that are then linked to via 
embedding in the website.
